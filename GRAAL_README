For creating a Graal VM JDK, the file jre\lib\jvm.cfg has to be modified such that it includes the line:
-client KNOWN

Before running the Graal VM, the following environment variables are needed:
- MAXINE: Pointing to a Maxine VM repository with compiled Java files.
- GRAAL: Pointing to a Graal VM repository with compiled Java files.

For starting the Graal VM, the two flags "-client -graal" have to be specified.
