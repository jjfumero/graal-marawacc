/**
 * The compiler-provided part of the bi-directional interface between the compiler and the runtime system of a virtual machine for the instruction set defined in
 * {@link com.oracle.graal.compiler.graphbuilder.Bytecodes}.
 *
 * The target hardware architecture is represented by {@link com.oracle.max.cri.ci.CiArchitecture} and the specific target machine
 * environment for a compiler instance is represented by {@link com.oracle.max.cri.ci.CiTarget}.
 * <p>
 * A {@code CiResult} encapsulates
 * {@linkplain com.oracle.max.cri.ci.CiStatistics compilation statistics}, possible {@linkplain com.oracle.max.cri.ci.CiBailout error state}
 * and the {@linkplain com.oracle.max.cri.ci.CiTargetMethod compiled code and metadata}.
 * {@link com.oracle.max.cri.ci.CiCodePos} and {@link com.oracle.max.cri.ci.CiDebugInfo} provide detailed information to the
 * runtime to support debugging and deoptimization of the compiled code.
 * <p>
 * The compiler manipulates {@link com.oracle.graal.api.meta.RiValue} instances that have a {@link com.oracle.graal.api.meta.RiKind}, and are
 * immutable. A concrete {@link com.oracle.graal.api.meta.RiValue value} is one of the following subclasses:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link com.oracle.graal.api.meta.RiConstant}: a constant value.
 * <li>{@link com.oracle.max.cri.ci.CiRegisterValue}: a value stored in a {@linkplain com.oracle.max.cri.ci.CiRegister target machine register}.
 * <li>{@link com.oracle.max.cri.ci.CiStackSlot}: a spill slot or an outgoing stack-based argument in a method's frame.
 * <li>{@link com.oracle.max.cri.ci.CiAddress}: an address in target machine memory.
 * <li>{@link com.oracle.graal.compiler.lir.CiVariable}: a value (cf. virtual register) that is yet to be bound to a target machine location (physical register or memory address).
 *</ul>
