/**
 * A node that results in a platform dependent breakpoint instruction being emitted. A number of
 * arguments can be associated with such a node for placing values of interest in the Java ABI
 * specified parameter locations corresponding to the kinds of the values. That is, the arguments
 * are set up as if the breakpoint instruction was a call to a compiled Java method.
 * <p>
 * A breakpoint is usually place by defining a node intrinsic method as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     {@literal @}NodeIntrinsic(BreakpointNode.class)
 *     static void breakpoint(Object object, Word mark, Word value) {
 *          throw new GraalInternalError("");
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that the signature is arbitrary. It's sole purpose is to capture values you may want to
 * inspect in the native debugger when the breakpoint is hit.
