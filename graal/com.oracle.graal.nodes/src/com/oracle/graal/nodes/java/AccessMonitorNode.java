/**
 * The {@code AccessMonitorNode} is the base class of both monitor acquisition and release.
 * <br>
 * The VM needs information about monitors in the debug information. This information is built from
 * the nesting level of {@link MonitorEnterNode} when the LIR is constructed. Therefore, monitor
 * nodes must not be removed from the graph unless it is guaranteed that the nesting level does not change.
 * For example, you must not remove a {@link MonitorEnterNode} for a thread-local object or for a recursive locking.
 * Instead, mark the node as {@link #eliminated}. This makes sure that the meta data still contains the complete
 * locking hierarchy.
 * <br>
 * The Java bytecode specification allows non-balanced locking. Graal does not handle such cases and throws a
 * {@link CiBailout} instead. Detecting non-balanced monitors during bytecode parsing is difficult, since the
 * node flowing into the {@link MonitorExitNode} can be a phi function hiding the node that was flowing into the
 * {@link MonitorEnterNode}. Optimization phases are free to throw {@link CiBailout} if they detect such cases.
 * Otherwise, they are detected during LIR construction.
