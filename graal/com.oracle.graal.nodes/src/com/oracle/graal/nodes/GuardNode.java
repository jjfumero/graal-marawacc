/**
 * A guard is a node that deoptimizes based on a conditional expression. Guards are not attached to
 * a certain frame state, they can move around freely and will always use the correct frame state
 * when the nodes are scheduled (i.e., the last emitted frame state). The node that is guarded has a
 * data dependency on the guard and the guard in turn has a data dependency on the condition. A
 * guard may only be executed if it is guaranteed that the guarded node is executed too (if no
 * exceptions are thrown). Therefore, an anchor is placed after a control flow split and the guard
 * has a data dependency to the anchor. The anchor is the most distant node that is post-dominated
 * by the guarded node and the guard can be scheduled anywhere between those two nodes. This ensures
 * maximum flexibility for the guard node and guarantees that deoptimization occurs only if the
 * control flow would have reached the guarded node (without taking exceptions into account).
