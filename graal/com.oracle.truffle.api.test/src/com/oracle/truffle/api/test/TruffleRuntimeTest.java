 * <h3>Accessing the Truffle Runtime</h3>

 * {@link Truffle#getRuntime()}. This method is guaranteed to return a non-null Truffle runtime object with an
 * identifying name. A Java Virtual Machine implementation can chose to replace the default implementation of the
 * {@link TruffleRuntime} interface with its own implementation for providing improved performance.
