 *
 * With snippets a typecheck is performed and if it was successful, a UnsafeCastNode is created.
 * For the read node, however, there is only a dependency to the UnsafeCastNode, but not to the
 * typecheck itself. With special crafting, it's possible to get the scheduler moving the
 * FloatingReadNode before the typecheck. Assuming the object is of the wrong type (here for
 * example A), an invalid field read is done.

 * In order to avoid this situation, an anchor node is introduced in CheckCastSnippts.
