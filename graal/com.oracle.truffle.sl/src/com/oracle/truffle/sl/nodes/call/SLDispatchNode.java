     * <p>
     * Since SL is a quite simple language, the benefit of the inline cache is quite small: after
     * checking that the actual function to be executed is the same as the cachedFuntion, we can
     * safely execute the cached call target. You can reasonably argue that caching the call target
     * is overkill, since we could just retrieve it via {@code function.getCallTarget()}. However,
     * in a more complex language the lookup of the call target is usually much more complicated
     * than in SL. In addition, caching the call target allows method inlining.
     * </p>

     * <p>
     * {@code limit = "INLINE_CACHE_SIZE"} Specifies the limit number of inline cache specialization
     * instantiations.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * {@code guards = "function == cachedFunction"} The inline cache check. Note that
     * cachedFunction is a final field so that the compiler can optimize the check.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * {@code assumptions = "cachedFunction.getCallTargetStable()"} Support for function
     * redefinition: When a function is redefined, the call target maintained by the SLFunction
     * object is change. To avoid a check for that, we use an Assumption that is invalidated by the
     * SLFunction when the change is performed. Since checking an assumption is a no-op in compiled
     * code, the assumption check performed by the DSL does not add any overhead during optimized
     * execution.
