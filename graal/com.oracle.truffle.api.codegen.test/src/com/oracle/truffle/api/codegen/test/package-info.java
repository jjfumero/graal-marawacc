/**
 * <p>This package contains basic tests of the Truffle-Source-Code-Generation (short Codegen) API and serves at the same
 * time as an introduction to the Codegen API for language implementors. Every test gives an example on how to use the construct explained in the class description.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This API relies heavily on the concepts described in {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.test}. We assume that the
 * reader is already familiarized with those concepts.
