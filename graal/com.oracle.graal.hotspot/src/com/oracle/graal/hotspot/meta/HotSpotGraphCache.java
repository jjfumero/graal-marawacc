/**
 * This class implements the graph caching system for the HotSpot platform.
 *
 * This implementation does not use a map to store the actual cached graphs. The problem is that such maps keep the
 * graph, and therefore the RiResolvedMethod referenced from the graph, alive. For some applications and benchmarks this
 * is a problem, e.g., the DaCapoScala "scalatest" benchmark will quickly run out of perm gen because of this.
 *
 * This cannot be solved with a WeakHashMap<RiResolvedMethod, Graph>, since the values within the map will keep the keys
 * alive. In order for this to work we would require a weak map in which the "strongness" of the value references
 * depends upon the reachability of the keys.
 *
 * Therefore the graph cache is implemented in such a way that it stores its cache entries within the RiResolvedMethod.
 * It uses the {@link ResolvedJavaMethod#compilerStorage()} map with the HotSpotGraphCache instance as key.
 * The cached graph will be kept alive as long as the RiResolvedMethod is alive, but does not prevent the method, and
 * therefore the class, from being unloaded.
 *
 * The {@link #cachedGraphIds} map is used to find the graphs that should be removed because of deoptimization, and to
 * enforce the graph cache size restriction.
