/**
 * Represents a direct call to a {@link CallTarget}. Direct calls are calls for which the
 * {@link CallTarget} remains the same for each consecutive call. This part of the Truffle API
 * enables the runtime system to perform additional optimizations on direct calls.
 *
 * Optimizations that can be applied to a {@link DirectCallNode} are inlining and call site
 * sensitive AST duplication. Inlining inlines this call site into the call graph of the parent
 * {@link CallTarget}. Call site sensitive AST duplication duplicates the {@link CallTarget} in an
 * uninitialized state to collect call site sensitive profiling information.
 *
 * Please note: This class is not intended to be subclassed by guest language implementations.
