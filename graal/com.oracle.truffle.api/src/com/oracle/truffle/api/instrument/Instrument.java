/**
 * A dynamically added/removed binding between a {@link Probe}, which provides notification of
 * {@linkplain TruffleEventReceiver execution events} taking place at a {@link Node} in a Guest
 * Language (GL) Truffle AST, and a {@linkplain TruffleEventReceiver receiver}, which consumes
 * notifications on behalf of an external tool.
 * <p>
 * <h4>Summary: How to "instrument" an AST location:</h4>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create an implementation of {@link TruffleEventReceiver} that responds to events on behalf of
 * a tool.</li>
 * <li>Create an Instrument via factory method {@link Instrument#create(TruffleEventReceiver)}.</li>
 * <li>"Attach" the Instrument to a Probe via {@link Probe#attach(Instrument)}, at which point event
 * notifications begin to arrive at the receiver.</li>
 * <li>When no longer needed, "detach" the Instrument via {@link Instrument#dispose()}, at which
 * point event notifications to the receiver cease, and the Instrument becomes unusable.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <h4>Options for creating receivers:</h4>
 * <p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Implement the interface {@link TruffleEventReceiver}. The event handling methods account for
 * both the entry into an AST node (about to call) and several possible kinds of exit from an AST
 * node (just returned).</li>
 * <li>Extend {@link DefaultEventReceiver}, which provides a no-op implementation of every
 * {@link TruffleEventReceiver} method; override the methods of interest.</li>
 * <li>Extend {@link SimpleEventReceiver}, where return values are ignored so only two methods (for
 * "enter" and "return") will notify all events.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <h4>General guidelines for receiver implementation:</h4>
 * <p>
 * When an Instrument is attached to a Probe, the receiver effectively becomes part of the executing
 * GL program; performance can be affected by the receiver's implementation.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Do not store {@link Frame} or {@link Node} references in fields.</li>
 * <li>Prefer {@code final} fields and (where performance is important) short methods.</li>
 * <li>If needed, pass along the {@link VirtualFrame} reference from an event notification as far as
 * possible through code that is expected to be inlined, since this incurs no runtime overhead. When
 * access to frame data is needed, substitute a more expensive {@linkplain Frame#materialize()
 * materialized} representation of the frame.</li>
 * <li>If a receiver calls back to its tool during event handling, and if performance is an issue,
 * then this should be through a final "callback" field in the instrument, and the called methods
 * should be minimal.</li>
 * <li>On the other hand, implementations should prevent Truffle from inlining beyond a reasonable
 * point with the method annotation {@link TruffleBoundary}.</li>
 * <li>The implicit "outer" pointer in a non-static inner class is a useful way to implement
 * callbacks to owner tools.</li>
 * <li>Primitive-valued return events are boxed for notification, but Truffle will eliminate the
 * boxing if they are cast back to their primitive values quickly (in particular before crossing any
 * {@link TruffleBoundary} annotations).
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h4>Allowing for AST cloning:</h4>
 * <p>
 * Truffle routinely <em>clones</em> ASTs, which has consequences for receiver implementation.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Even though a {@link Probe} is uniquely associated with a particular location in the
 * executing Guest Language program, execution events at that location will in general be
 * implemented by different {@link Node} instances, i.e. <em>clones</em> of the originally probed
 * node.</li>
 * <li>Because of <em>cloning</em> the {@link Node} supplied with notifications to a particular
 * receiver will vary, but because they all represent the same GL program location the events should
 * be treated as equivalent for most purposes.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h4>Access to execution state:</h4>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Event notification arguments provide primary access to the GL program's execution states:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Node}: the concrete node (in one of the AST's clones) from which the event originated.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@link VirtualFrame}: the current execution frame.
 * </ul>
 * <li>Some global information is available, for example the execution
 * {@linkplain TruffleRuntime#iterateFrames(FrameInstanceVisitor) stack}.</li>
 * <li>Additional information needed by a receiver could be stored when created, preferably
 * {@code final} of course. For example, a reference to the {@link Probe} to which the receiver's
 * Instrument has been attached would give access to its corresponding
 * {@linkplain Probe#getProbedSourceSection() source location} or to the collection of
 * {@linkplain SyntaxTag tags} currently applied to the Probe.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h4>Activating and deactivating Instruments:</h4>
 * <p>
 * Instruments are <em>single-use</em>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>An instrument becomes active only when <em>attached</em> to a Probe via
 * {@link Probe#attach(Instrument)}, and it may only be attached to a single Probe. It is a runtime
 * error to attempt attaching a previously attached instrument.</li>
 * <li>Attaching an instrument modifies every existing clone of the AST to which it is being
 * attached, which can trigger deoptimization.</li>
 * <li>The method {@link Instrument#dispose()} makes an instrument inactive by removing it from the
 * Probe to which it was attached and rendering it permanently inert.</li>
 * <li>Disposal removes the implementation of an instrument from all ASTs to which it was attached,
 * which can trigger deoptimization.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h4>Sharing receivers:</h4>
 * <p>
 * Although an Instrument may only be attached to a single Probe, a receiver can be shared among
 * multiple Instruments. This can be useful for observing events that might happen at different
 * locations in a single AST, for example all assignments to a particular variable. In this case a
 * new Instrument would be created and attached at each assignment node, but all the Instruments
 * would be created with the same receiver.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> experimental; under development.
