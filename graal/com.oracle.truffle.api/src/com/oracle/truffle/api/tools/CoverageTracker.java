/**
 * An {@link InstrumentationTool} that counts interpreter <em>execution calls</em> to AST nodes that
 * hold a specified {@linkplain SyntaxTag tag}, tabulated by source and line number associated with
 * each node. Tags are presumed to be applied external to the tool. If no tag is specified,
 * {@linkplain StandardSyntaxTag#STATEMENT STATEMENT} is used, corresponding to conventional
 * behavior for code coverage tools.
 * <p>
 * <b>Tool Life Cycle</b>
 * <p>
 * See {@link InstrumentationTool} for the life cycle common to all such tools.
 * <p>
 * <b>Execution Counts</b>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>"Execution call" on a node is is defined as invocation of a node method that is instrumented
 * to produce the event {@link TruffleEventReceiver#enter(Node, VirtualFrame)};</li>
 * <li>Execution calls are tabulated only at <em>instrumented</em> nodes, i.e. those for which
 * {@linkplain Node#isInstrumentable() isInstrumentable() == true};</li>
 * <li>Execution calls are tabulated only at nodes present in the AST when originally created;
 * dynamically added nodes will not be instrumented.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <b>Results</b>
 * <p>
 * A modification-safe copy of the {@linkplain #getCounts() counts} can be retrieved at any time,
 * without effect on the state of the tool.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A "default" {@linkplain #print(PrintStream) print()} method can summarizes the current counts at
 * any time in a simple textual format, with no other effect on the state of the tool.
 * </p>
