REM This is the interactive build setup script (as opposed to the batch
REM build execution script). It creates $HotSpotBuildSpace if necessary,
REM copies the appropriate files out of $HotSpotWorkSpace into it, and
REM builds and runs MakeDeps in it. This has the side-effect of creating
REM the vm.vcproj file in the buildspace, which is then used in Visual C++.
REM 
REM The generated project file depends upon the include databases. If
REM those are changed then MakeDeps is rerun.

REM
REM Since we don't have uname and we could be cross-compiling,
REM Use the compiler to determine which ARCH we are building
REM 
REM Note: Running this batch file from the Windows command shell requires
REM that "grep" be accessible on the PATH. An MKS install does this.
