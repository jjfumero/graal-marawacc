//    The remainder of the word points to the head of a singly-linked list
//    of threads blocked on the lock.
//
// *  The current implementation of muxAcquire-muxRelease uses its own
//    dedicated Thread._MuxEvent instance.  If we're interested in
//    minimizing the peak number of extant ParkEvent instances then
//    we could eliminate _MuxEvent and "borrow" _ParkEvent as long
//    as certain invariants were satisfied.  Specifically, care would need
//    to be taken with regards to consuming unpark() "permits".
//    A safe rule of thumb is that a thread would never call muxAcquire()
//    if it's enqueued (cxq, EntryList, WaitList, etc) and will subsequently
//    park().  Otherwise the _ParkEvent park() operation in muxAcquire() could
//    consume an unpark() permit intended for monitorenter, for instance.
//    One way around this would be to widen the restricted-range semaphore
//    implemented in park().  Another alternative would be to provide
//    multiple instances of the PlatformEvent() for each thread.  One
//    instance would be dedicated to muxAcquire-muxRelease, for instance.
//
// *  Usage:
//    -- Only as leaf locks
//    -- for short-term locking only as muxAcquire does not perform
//       thread state transitions.
//
// Alternatives:
// *  We could implement muxAcquire and muxRelease with MCS or CLH locks
//    but with parking or spin-then-park instead of pure spinning.
// *  Use Taura-Oyama-Yonenzawa locks.
// *  It's possible to construct a 1-0 lock if we encode the lockword as
//    (List,LockByte).  Acquire will CAS the full lockword while Release
//    will STB 0 into the LockByte.  The 1-0 scheme admits stranding, so
//    acquiring threads use timers (ParkTimed) to detect and recover from
//    the stranding window.  Thread/Node structures must be aligned on 256-byte
//    boundaries by using placement-new.
// *  Augment MCS with advisory back-link fields maintained with CAS().
//    Pictorially:  LockWord -> T1 <-> T2 <-> T3 <-> ... <-> Tn <-> Owner.
//    The validity of the backlinks must be ratified before we trust the value.
//    If the backlinks are invalid the exiting thread must back-track through the
//    the forward links, which are always trustworthy.
// *  Add a successor indication.  The LockWord is currently encoded as
//    (List, LOCKBIT:1).  We could also add a SUCCBIT or an explicit _succ variable
//    to provide the usual futile-wakeup optimization.
//    See RTStt for details.
// *  Consider schedctl.sc_nopreempt to cover the critical section.

// ObjectMonitor Lifecycle
// -----------------------
// Inflation unlinks monitors from the global gFreeList and
// associates them with objects.  Deflation -- which occurs at
// STW-time -- disassociates idle monitors from objects.  Such
// scavenged monitors are returned to the gFreeList.
//
// The global list is protected by ListLock.  All the critical sections
// are short and operate in constant-time.
//
// ObjectMonitors reside in type-stable memory (TSM) and are immortal.
//
// Lifecycle:
// --   unassigned and on the global free list
// --   unassigned and on a thread's private omFreeList
// --   assigned to an object.  The object is inflated and the mark refers
//      to the objectmonitor.
//
// TODO-FIXME:
//
// *  We currently protect the gFreeList with a simple lock.
//    An alternate lock-free scheme would be to pop elements from the gFreeList
//    with CAS.  This would be safe from ABA corruption as long we only
//    recycled previously appearing elements onto the list in deflate_idle_monitors()
//    at STW-time.  Completely new elements could always be pushed onto the gFreeList
//    with CAS.  Elements that appeared previously on the list could only
//    be installed at STW-time.
//
// *  For efficiency and to help reduce the store-before-CAS penalty
//    the objectmonitors on gFreeList or local free lists should be ready to install
//    with the exception of _header and _object.  _object can be set after inflation.
//    In particular, keep all objectMonitors on a thread's private list in ready-to-install
//    state with m.Owner set properly.
//
// *  We could all diffuse contention by using multiple global (FreeList, Lock)
//    pairs -- threads could use trylock() and a cyclic-scan strategy to search for
//    an unlocked free list.
//
// *  Add lifecycle tags and assert()s.
//
// *  Be more consistent about when we clear an objectmonitor's fields:
//    A.  After extracting the objectmonitor from a free list.
//    B.  After adding an objectmonitor to a free list.

// Specifically, we would add a new sub-list of objectmonitors
// that are in-circulation and potentially active.  deflate_idle_monitors()
// would scan only that list.  Other monitors could reside on a quiescent
// list.  Such sequestered monitors wouldn't need to be scanned by
// deflate_idle_monitors().  omAlloc() would first check the global free list,
// then the quiescent list, and, failing those, would allocate a new block.
// Deflate_idle_monitors() would scavenge and move monitors to the

// typically drives the scavenge rate.  Large heaps can mean infrequent GC,
// which in turn can mean large(r) numbers of objectmonitors in circulation.

// Adaptive spin-then-block - rational spinning
//
// Note that we spin "globally" on _owner with a classic SMP-polite TATAS
// algorithm.  On high order SMP systems it would be better to start with
// a brief global spin and then revert to spinning locally.  In the spirit of MCS/CLH,
// a contending thread could enqueue itself on the cxq and then spin locally
// on a thread-specific variable such as its ParkEvent._Event flag.
// That's left as an exercise for the reader.  Note that global spinning is
// not problematic on Niagara, as the L2$ serves the interconnect and has both
// low latency and massive bandwidth.
//
// Broadly, we can fix the spin frequency -- that is, the % of contended lock
// acquisition attempts where we opt to spin --  at 100% and vary the spin count
// (duration) or we can fix the count at approximately the duration of
// a context switch and vary the frequency.   Of course we could also
// vary both satisfying K == Frequency * Duration, where K is adaptive by monitor.
// See http://j2se.east/~dice/PERSIST/040824-AdaptiveSpinning.html.
//
// This implementation varies the duration "D", where D varies with
// the success rate of recent spin attempts. (D is capped at approximately
// length of a round-trip context switch).  The success rate for recent
// spin attempts is a good predictor of the success rate of future spin
// attempts.  The mechanism adapts automatically to varying critical
// section length (lock modality), system load and degree of parallelism.
// D is maintained per-monitor in _SpinDuration and is initialized
// optimistically.  Spin frequency is fixed at 100%.
//
// Note that _SpinDuration is volatile, but we update it without locks
// or atomics.  The code is designed so that _SpinDuration stays within
// a reasonable range even in the presence of races.  The arithmetic
// operations on _SpinDuration are closed over the domain of legal values,
// so at worst a race will install and older but still legal value.
// At the very worst this introduces some apparent non-determinism.
// We might spin when we shouldn't or vice-versa, but since the spin
// count are relatively short, even in the worst case, the effect is harmless.
//
// Care must be taken that a low "D" value does not become an
// an absorbing state.  Transient spinning failures -- when spinning
// is overall profitable -- should not cause the system to converge
// on low "D" values.  We want spinning to be stable and predictable
// and fairly responsive to change and at the same time we don't want
// it to oscillate, become metastable, be "too" non-deterministic,
// or converge on or enter undesirable stable absorbing states.
//
// We implement a feedback-based control system -- using past behavior
// to predict future behavior.  We face two issues: (a) if the
// input signal is random then the spin predictor won't provide optimal
// results, and (b) if the signal frequency is too high then the control
// system, which has some natural response lag, will "chase" the signal.
// (b) can arise from multimodal lock hold times.  Transient preemption
// can also result in apparent bimodal lock hold times.
// Although sub-optimal, neither condition is particularly harmful, as
// in the worst-case we'll spin when we shouldn't or vice-versa.
// The maximum spin duration is rather short so the failure modes aren't bad.
// To be conservative, I've tuned the gain in system to bias toward
// _not spinning.  Relatedly, the system can sometimes enter a mode where it
// "rings" or oscillates between spinning and not spinning.  This happens
// when spinning is just on the cusp of profitability, however, so the
// situation is not dire.  The state is benign -- there's no need to add
// hysteresis control to damp the transition rate between spinning and
// not spinning.

//
// Spin-then-block strategies ...
//
// Thoughts on ways to improve spinning :
//
// *  Periodically call {psr_}getloadavg() while spinning, and
//    permit unbounded spinning if the load average is <
//    the number of processors.  Beware, however, that getloadavg()
//    is exceptionally fast on solaris (about 1/10 the cost of a full
//    spin cycle, but quite expensive on linux.  Beware also, that
//    multiple JVMs could "ring" or oscillate in a feedback loop.
//    Sufficient damping would solve that problem.
//
// *  We currently use spin loops with iteration counters to approximate
//    spinning for some interval.  Given the availability of high-precision
//    time sources such as gethrtime(), %TICK, %STICK, RDTSC, etc., we should
//    someday reimplement the spin loops to duration-based instead of iteration-based.
//
// *  Don't spin if there are more than N = (CPUs/2) threads
//        currently spinning on the monitor (or globally).
//    That is, limit the number of concurrent spinners.
//    We might also limit the # of spinners in the JVM, globally.
//
// *  If a spinning thread observes _owner change hands it should
//    abort the spin (and park immediately) or at least debit
//    the spin counter by a large "penalty".
//
// *  Classically, the spin count is either K*(CPUs-1) or is a
//        simple constant that approximates the length of a context switch.
//    We currently use a value -- computed by a special utility -- that
//    approximates round-trip context switch times.
//
// *  Normally schedctl_start()/_stop() is used to advise the kernel
//    to avoid preempting threads that are running in short, bounded
//    critical sections.  We could use the schedctl hooks in an inverted
//    sense -- spinners would set the nopreempt flag, but poll the preempt
//    pending flag.  If a spinner observed a pending preemption it'd immediately
//    abort the spin and park.   As such, the schedctl service acts as
//    a preemption warning mechanism.
//
// *  In lieu of spinning, if the system is running below saturation
//    (that is, loadavg() << #cpus), we can instead suppress futile
//    wakeup throttling, or even wake more than one successor at exit-time.
//    The net effect is largely equivalent to spinning.  In both cases,
//    contending threads go ONPROC and opportunistically attempt to acquire
//    the lock, decreasing lock handover latency at the expense of wasted
//    cycles and context switching.
//
// *  We might to spin less after we've parked as the thread will
//    have less $ and TLB affinity with the processor.
//    Likewise, we might spin less if we come ONPROC on a different
//    processor or after a long period (>> rechose_interval).
//
// *  A table-driven state machine similar to Solaris' dispadmin scheduling
//    tables might be a better design.  Instead of encoding information in
//    _SpinDuration, _SpinFreq and _SpinClock we'd just use explicit,
//    discrete states.   Success or failure during a spin would drive
//    state transitions, and each state node would contain a spin count.
//
// *  If the processor is operating in a mode intended to conserve power
//    (such as Intel's SpeedStep) or to reduce thermal output (thermal
//    step-down mode) then the Java synchronization subsystem should
//    forgo spinning.
//
// *  The minimum spin duration should be approximately the worst-case
//    store propagation latency on the platform.  That is, the time
//    it takes a store on CPU A to become visible on CPU B, where A and
//    B are "distant".
//
// *  We might want to factor a thread's priority in the spin policy.
//    Threads with a higher priority might spin for slightly longer.
//    Similarly, if we use back-off in the TATAS loop, lower priority
//    threads might back-off longer.  We don't currently use a
//    thread's priority when placing it on the entry queue.  We may
//    want to consider doing so in future releases.
//
// *  We might transiently drop a thread's scheduling priority while it spins.
//    SCHED_BATCH on linux and FX scheduling class at priority=0 on Solaris
//    would suffice.  We could even consider letting the thread spin indefinitely at
//    a depressed or "idle" priority.  This brings up fairness issues, however --
//    in a saturated system a thread would with a reduced priority could languish
//    for extended periods on the ready queue.
//
// *  While spinning try to use the otherwise wasted time to help the VM make
//    progress:
//
//    -- YieldTo() the owner, if the owner is OFFPROC but ready
//       Done our remaining quantum directly to the ready thread.
//       This helps "push" the lock owner through the critical section.
//       It also tends to improve affinity/locality as the lock
//       "migrates" less frequently between CPUs.
//    -- Walk our own stack in anticipation of blocking.  Memoize the roots.
//    -- Perform strand checking for other thread.  Unpark potential strandees.
//    -- Help GC: trace or mark -- this would need to be a bounded unit of work.
//       Unfortunately this will pollute our $ and TLBs.  Recall that we
//       spin to avoid context switching -- context switching has an
//       immediate cost in latency, a disruptive cost to other strands on a CMT
//       processor, and an amortized cost because of the D$ and TLB cache
//       reload transient when the thread comes back ONPROC and repopulates
//       $s and TLBs.
//    -- call getloadavg() to see if the system is saturated.  It'd probably
//       make sense to call getloadavg() half way through the spin.
//       If the system isn't at full capacity the we'd simply reset
//       the spin counter to and extend the spin attempt.
//    -- Doug points out that we should use the same "helping" policy
//       in thread.yield().
//
// *  Try MONITOR-MWAIT on systems that support those instructions.
//
// *  The spin statistics that drive spin decisions & frequency are
//    maintained in the objectmonitor structure so if we deflate and reinflate
//    we lose spin state.  In practice this is not usually a concern
//    as the default spin state after inflation is aggressive (optimistic)
//    and tends toward spinning.  So in the worst case for a lock where
//    spinning is not profitable we may spin unnecessarily for a brief
//    period.  But then again, if a lock is contended it'll tend not to deflate
//    in the first place.

// Theory of operations -- Monitors lists, thread residency, etc:
//
// * A thread acquires ownership of a monitor by successfully
//   CAS()ing the _owner field from null to non-null.
//
// * Invariant: A thread appears on at most one monitor list --
//   cxq, EntryList or WaitSet -- at any one time.
//
// * Contending threads "push" themselves onto the cxq with CAS
//   and then spin/park.
//
// * After a contending thread eventually acquires the lock it must
//   dequeue itself from either the EntryList or the cxq.
//
// * The exiting thread identifies and unparks an "heir presumptive"
//   tentative successor thread on the EntryList.  Critically, the
//   exiting thread doesn't unlink the successor thread from the EntryList.
//   After having been unparked, the wakee will recontend for ownership of
//   the monitor.   The successor (wakee) will either acquire the lock or
//   re-park itself.
//
//   Succession is provided for by a policy of competitive handoff.
//   The exiting thread does _not_ grant or pass ownership to the
//   successor thread.  (This is also referred to as "handoff" succession").
//   Instead the exiting thread releases ownership and possibly wakes
//   a successor, so the successor can (re)compete for ownership of the lock.
//   If the EntryList is empty but the cxq is populated the exiting
//   thread will drain the cxq into the EntryList.  It does so by
//   by detaching the cxq (installing null with CAS) and folding
//   the threads from the cxq into the EntryList.  The EntryList is
//   doubly linked, while the cxq is singly linked because of the
//   CAS-based "push" used to enqueue recently arrived threads (RATs).
//
// * Concurrency invariants:
//
//   -- only the monitor owner may access or mutate the EntryList.
//      The mutex property of the monitor itself protects the EntryList
//      from concurrent interference.
//   -- Only the monitor owner may detach the cxq.
//
// * The monitor entry list operations avoid locks, but strictly speaking
//   they're not lock-free.  Enter is lock-free, exit is not.
//   See http://j2se.east/~dice/PERSIST/040825-LockFreeQueues.html
//
// * The cxq can have multiple concurrent "pushers" but only one concurrent
//   detaching thread.  This mechanism is immune from the ABA corruption.
//   More precisely, the CAS-based "push" onto cxq is ABA-oblivious.
//
// * Taken together, the cxq and the EntryList constitute or form a
//   single logical queue of threads stalled trying to acquire the lock.
//   We use two distinct lists to improve the odds of a constant-time
//   dequeue operation after acquisition (in the ::enter() epilog) and
//   to reduce heat on the list ends.  (c.f. Michael Scott's "2Q" algorithm).
//   A key desideratum is to minimize queue & monitor metadata manipulation
//   that occurs while holding the monitor lock -- that is, we want to
//   minimize monitor lock holds times.  Note that even a small amount of
//   fixed spinning will greatly reduce the # of enqueue-dequeue operations
//   on EntryList|cxq.  That is, spinning relieves contention on the "inner"
//   locks and monitor metadata.
//
//   Cxq points to the the set of Recently Arrived Threads attempting entry.
//   Because we push threads onto _cxq with CAS, the RATs must take the form of
//   a singly-linked LIFO.  We drain _cxq into EntryList  at unlock-time when
//   the unlocking thread notices that EntryList is null but _cxq is != null.
//
//   The EntryList is ordered by the prevailing queue discipline and
//   can be organized in any convenient fashion, such as a doubly-linked list or
//   a circular doubly-linked list.  Critically, we want insert and delete operations
//   to operate in constant-time.  If we need a priority queue then something akin
//   to Solaris' sleepq would work nicely.  Viz.,
//   http://agg.eng/ws/on10_nightly/source/usr/src/uts/common/os/sleepq.c.
//   Queue discipline is enforced at ::exit() time, when the unlocking thread
//   drains the cxq into the EntryList, and orders or reorders the threads on the
//   EntryList accordingly.
//
//   Barring "lock barging", this mechanism provides fair cyclic ordering,
//   somewhat similar to an elevator-scan.
//
// * The monitor synchronization subsystem avoids the use of native
//   synchronization primitives except for the narrow platform-specific
//   park-unpark abstraction.  See the comments in os_solaris.cpp regarding
//   the semantics of park-unpark.  Put another way, this monitor implementation
//   depends only on atomic operations and park-unpark.  The monitor subsystem
//   manages all RUNNING->BLOCKED and BLOCKED->READY transitions while the
//   underlying OS manages the READY<->RUN transitions.
//
// * Waiting threads reside on the WaitSet list -- wait() puts
//   the caller onto the WaitSet.
//
// * notify() or notifyAll() simply transfers threads from the WaitSet to
//   either the EntryList or cxq.  Subsequent exit() operations will
//   unpark the notifyee.  Unparking a notifee in notify() is inefficient -
//   it's likely the notifyee would simply impale itself on the lock held
//   by the notifier.
//
// * An interesting alternative is to encode cxq as (List,LockByte) where
//   the LockByte is 0 iff the monitor is owned.  _owner is simply an auxiliary
//   variable, like _recursions, in the scheme.  The threads or Events that form
//   the list would have to be aligned in 256-byte addresses.  A thread would
//   try to acquire the lock or enqueue itself with CAS, but exiting threads
//   could use a 1-0 protocol and simply STB to set the LockByte to 0.
//   Note that is is *not* word-tearing, but it does presume that full-word
//   CAS operations are coherent with intermix with STB operations.  That's true
//   on most common processors.

// 1-0 exit
// ~~~~~~~~
// ::exit() uses a canonical 1-1 idiom with a MEMBAR although some of
// the fast-path operators have been optimized so the common ::exit()
// operation is 1-0.  See i486.ad fast_unlock(), for instance.
// The code emitted by fast_unlock() elides the usual MEMBAR.  This
// greatly improves latency -- MEMBAR and CAS having considerable local
// latency on modern processors -- but at the cost of "stranding".  Absent the
// MEMBAR, a thread in fast_unlock() can race a thread in the slow
// ::enter() path, resulting in the entering thread being stranding
// and a progress-liveness failure.   Stranding is extremely rare.
// We use timers (timed park operations) & periodic polling to detect
// and recover from stranding.  Potentially stranded threads periodically
// wake up and poll the lock.  See the usage of the _Responsible variable.
//
// The CAS() in enter provides for safety and exclusion, while the CAS or
// MEMBAR in exit provides for progress and avoids stranding.  1-0 locking
// eliminates the CAS/MEMBAR from the exist path, but it admits stranding.
// We detect and recover from stranding with timers.
//
// If a thread transiently strands it'll park until (a) another
// thread acquires the lock and then drops the lock, at which time the
// exiting thread will notice and unpark the stranded thread, or, (b)
// the timer expires.  If the lock is high traffic then the stranding latency
// will be low due to (a).  If the lock is low traffic then the odds of
// stranding are lower, although the worst-case stranding latency
// is longer.  Critically, we don't want to put excessive load in the
// platform's timer subsystem.  We want to minimize both the timer injection
// rate (timers created/sec) as well as the number of timers active at
// any one time.  (more precisely, we want to minimize timer-seconds, which is
// the integral of the # of active timers at any instant over time).
// Both impinge on OS scalability.  Given that, at most one thread parked on
// a monitor will use a timer.

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The raw monitor subsystem is entirely distinct from normal
// java-synchronization or jni-synchronization.  raw monitors are not
// associated with objects.  They can be implemented in any manner
// that makes sense.  The original implementors decided to piggy-back
// the raw-monitor implementation on the existing Java objectMonitor mechanism.
// This flaw needs to fixed.  We should reimplement raw monitors as sui-generis.
// Specifically, we should not implement raw monitors via java monitors.
// Time permitting, we should disentangle and deconvolve the two implementations
// and move the resulting raw monitor implementation over to the JVMTI directories.
// Ideally, the raw monitor implementation would be built on top of
// park-unpark and nothing else.
//
// raw monitors are used mainly by JVMTI
// The raw monitor implementation borrows the ObjectMonitor structure,
// but the operators are degenerate and extremely simple.
//
// Mixed use of a single objectMonitor instance -- as both a raw monitor
// and a normal java monitor -- is not permissible.
//
// Note that we use the single RawMonitor_lock to protect queue operations for
// _all_ raw monitors.  This is a scalability impediment, but since raw monitor usage
// is deprecated and rare, this is not of concern.  The RawMonitor_lock can not
// be held indefinitely.  The critical sections must be short and bounded.
